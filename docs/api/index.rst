xibless API
===========

This is the API documentation for each class in ``xibless``. Classes in the API documentation
contain methods, which can of course be called, but they also contain sttributes (such as ``x``,
``y``, ``font``, etc.). These can be set directly in this fashion::

    button.x = 42
