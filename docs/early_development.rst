Early Development
=================

``xibless`` is in very early development and there's no API documentation yet. For now, you'll have
to figure that API from the demos and by digging directly in the source. Also, note that this API
could wildly change before v1.0.

Also, the number of rough edges at the moment are incalculable. There are no error message for
invalid UI scripts, so it might be very hard, for now, to figure out why your scripts don't work.

Oh, yes, and memory leaks, there's tons of them.
